It was time for a comprehensive tractor test to see if the new 700er meets Fendt\\'s promises. Unlike the known 700er series, the Fendt 728 Vario sports a new AgcoPower Core 75 with 7.5 liters. The 728 Vario features a nominal output of 208 kW/283 HP at 1700 rpm. Along with the top model, it boasts Dynamic Performance, adding another 15 kW/20 HP. The technology includes a robust hydraulic drive and effective pressure regulation, touching on requests for efficient front loader applications. We were keen to see how the test candidate performed in power and efficiency. Given Fendt\\'s reputation with the 900er and 1000er series using a low-speed concept, it was of particular interest. The innovative \"Concentric Air System\" deserves mention akin to its companion unit featuring a Voith designed hydraulic ventilator. Therefore, the cooling package stabilizes the entire operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the innovations, the starting performance was critically evaluated, holding at precisely 101%. Coupled with a step-less gearbox, both in high range testers remain unconvinced by its practical dynamics. At the engine\\'s optimal revs with intensified boost pressure, the transmission gears ramp up speeds swiftly. All with diesel consumption within reason, showing an efficient 220 g/kWh (+21.8 g/kWh AdBlue). Measurement at peak power revealed 217.8 g/kWh (+21.1 g/kWh) noted in a Maximal Power run. On PTO shafts maximum efficiency at 203 kW was observed between 1,500-1,700 rpm offering consistent results. The adjusted data accounted analytically for these values, with variables like total power consumption including electronically regulated cooling operations substantiated in real-world field data. The presentation was impressive, showing specific diesel values of 242 g/kWh - placing it among the top five most efficient tractors currently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 728 Vario\\'s unique combination of engine power, new design, and improved fuel efficiency makes it a leading model in Fendt\\'s 700er series, substantiated by our detailed field tests and comparative data analysis of real operational conditions.'}\n",

The practice examines mowing quality and soil pressure with and without load-relief control, as illustrated across various phases.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the level ground scenario, the attachment follows the ground contour precisely. During the transition to a hill, without position control and relief control, the mower can damage the sward and soil due to over-compressed springs that cannot provide relief, resulting in higher contact pressure. This situation allows dirt to enter the feed and leads to reduced quality. With position control and relief control, a pressure sensor maintains the set contact pressure of the mower by adjusting the pressure as ground height changes. This ensures consistent mowing height while avoiding dirt contamination and promoting better regrowth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the transition to the peak, without these controls, the mower's springs overstretch, providing excessive relief, causing the mower to swerve upwards, leaving material unmowed. When position control and relief control are engaged, the pressure sensor detects pressure changes and adjusts downwards, ensuring all material is mowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the return to level ground, without control systems, the mower's springs remain over-compressed, causing higher contact pressure and resulting in more soil and dirt in the feed.

      "Our first driving test (profi 10/2022) covered the new 700 series from Fendt with models from 720 Vario up to 728 Vario already introduced. It was time for a comprehensive tractor test to see if the new 700er meets Fendt's promises. Unlike the known 700er series, the Fendt 728 Vario sports a new AgcoPower Core 75 with 7.5 liters. The 728 Vario features a nominal output of 208 kW/283 HP at 1700 rpm. Along with the top model, it boasts Dynamic Performance, adding another 15 kW/20 HP. The technology includes a robust hydraulic drive and effective pressure regulation, touching on requests for efficient front loader applications. We were keen to see how the test candidate performed in power and efficiency. Given Fendt's reputation with the 900er and 1000er series using a low-speed concept, it was of particular interest. The innovative \"Concentric Air System\" deserves mention akin to its companion unit featuring a Voith designed hydraulic ventilator. Therefore, the cooling package stabilizes the entire operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the innovations, the starting performance was critically evaluated, holding at precisely 101%. Coupled with a step-less gearbox, both in high range testers remain unconvinced by its practical dynamics. At the engine's optimal revs with intensified boost pressure, the transmission gears ramp up speeds swiftly. All with diesel consumption within reason, showing an efficient 220 g/kWh (+21.8 g/kWh AdBlue). Measurement at peak power revealed 217.8 g/kWh (+21.1 g/kWh) noted in a Maximal Power run. On PTO shafts maximum efficiency at 203 kW was observed between 1,500-1,700 rpm offering consistent results. The adjusted data accounted analytically for these values, with variables like total power consumption including electronically regulated cooling operations substantiated in real-world field data. The presentation was impressive, showing specific diesel values of 242 g/kWh - placing it among the top five most efficient tractors currently.\n",

      "The Fendt 700 Vario Gen7, introduced here, features unique solutions that enhance productivity and efficiency, making work significantly faster. The tractor is equipped with seven innovative technologies, each contributing to its outstanding performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, the Fendt iD low-speed concept is integrated with a newly developed AGCO Power engine that has a 7.5-liter capacity. This concept is characterized by low fuel consumption thanks to a significant reduction of the nominal speed to 1,700 rpm. The perfect combination of engine, transmission, fan, and hydraulics, along with all auxiliary components, is adjusted to the ideal speeds. This results in the highest torque even at low speeds, continuous low fuel consumption, and extended life performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the Fendt DynamicPerformance (DP) introduces an intelligent multi-performance concept for the Fendt 728 Vario. It provides up to 20 hp extra power regardless of driving speed, with a nominal speed of 283 hp plus an additional 20 hp power on the Fendt 728 Vario. This extra power is available while cultivating and when stationary compared to conventional boost concepts. It ensures more area performance and higher productivity, a lighter tractor with higher power, and reduced fuel consumption per hectare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, the Intelligent VarioDrive maximizes comfort by eliminating the need for travel range switching between I and II. It features an independent drive for the front and rear axle, negating the necessity for a manual all-wheel drive switch. The optimal engine and transmission matching with the Fendt iD low-speed concept allows for the smallest possible turning radius due to pull-in turn effect, which is optimal for front loader work. The oil change interval is every 2,000 operating hours with no special oil needed, and it offers zippy handling capabilities in the ranges of 40, 50, or up to 60 km/h.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fourth aspect, the tractor is notable for its extremely low power-to-weight ratio combined with maximum payload, with a ratio of only 30.5 kg per hp for the top model Fendt 728 Vario. The high payload capacity reaches up to 6.2 tons with a permissible gross weight of 15 tons in the 40 km/h and 50 km/h versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth component highlights the cooling concept, which uses a Concentric Air System (CAS) with a pressurized fan. This system utilizes a concentric, pressure fan with an independent, hydraulic drive. The extremely narrow compact fan allows for outstanding visibility and a tight steering angle, enabling excellent maneuverability. The high efficiency setup, with a fan arrangement in front of the cooling package, generates up to 40% less drive power than standard fans, providing more available power and fuel savings. The reversible fan function allows independent cleaning of the radiator grill tailored to specific units. Interval-controlled reversible fan functions are programmable from the terminal and provide maximum comfort when integrated into the headland management system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixthly, the tractor exhibits superior maneuverability, with a turning radius as low as 10.0 meters equipped with 540/65 R30 tires and 11.8 meters with 600/70 R30 tires, ensuring enormous maneuverability in the 300 hp class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the high-performance hydraulics are highlighted, with a flow rate of up to 220 liters. The modular hydraulic coupling system, including UDK, DUDK, and flat-face FFC couplings at both the front and rear, requires less pressure loss and reduces consumption, being leak-free. It includes a load relief control for the rear power lift and a hydraulic top link with lifting aid at the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visual elements show a green Fendt 700 Vario Gen7 tractor with distinctive red wheels, a front loader attachment point, hydraulic lines, and tires adapted for superior maneuverability. Each highlighted feature on the tractor is numbered correlatively with the text explanations, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of each technological advancement.
